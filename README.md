# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Air Passengers Data

# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a comprehensive time series analysis and forecasting of air passenger data. The project uses Python to analyze historical air travel trends and predict future passenger numbers.

# Contents
Data Loading and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis

Time Series Decomposition

Stationarity Tests

ARIMA Modeling

Forecasting

# Requirements

Python 3.x

Libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

statsmodels

# Dataset
The analysis uses the 'airpassengers.csv' file, which contains monthly totals of airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

# Key Features
Time series visualization

Seasonal decomposition

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity

ACF and PACF plot analysis

ARIMA model implementation

Future passenger number predictions

# Usage
Ensure all required libraries are installed.

Place the 'airpassengers.csv' file in the same directory as the notebook.

Run the Jupyter Notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

# Results
The notebook provides insights into historical air travel patterns and generates forecasts for future passenger numbers. Visualizations and statistical tests help in understanding the underlying trends and seasonality in the data.
